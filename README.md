# Red de Rescate Animal (RRA) 

Animal Rescue Network (ARN) is a non-profit organization dedicated to saving and protecting endangered animals. ARN's mission is to create a network of shelters, volunteers and adoptions to provide animals with a safe and loving home. With the help of a website designed in C# .NET, SQL database and MVC architecture, ARN provides an efficient and accessible platform to connect with shelters, adopters and donors. The ARN website will allow visitors to easily navigate through a wide range of options, from finding animals available for adoption to donating online to support shelters and animals. In addition, ARN's database will maintain up-to-date records of shelters, animals, and adoptions, allowing ARN to monitor and improve its impact.
